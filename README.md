## Working with the Fetch API

# Learning the Fetch API in JavaScript

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey of mastering the Fetch API in JavaScript! This repository contains various files and examples that I used to practice and understand everything about making network requests with the Fetch API.

## Why the Fetch API?

The Fetch API provides a modern, promise-based approach to making HTTP requests in JavaScript. It is more powerful and flexible compared to the older XMLHttpRequest and is widely used in modern web development.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Fetch API:

### 1. Basic Fetch Requests

- **basic-get-request.js**: Simple GET requests to fetch data from an API and handle JSON responses.
- **basic-error-handling.js**: Examples of how to handle errors in Fetch requests.

### 2. Working with URLs

- **constructing-urls.js**: Demonstrates how to construct and work with URLs and query parameters.
- **dynamic-urls.js**: Examples of handling dynamic parameters in URLs.

### 3. Handling Different Types of Requests

- **post-request.js**: Sending data with POST requests.
- **put-request.js**: Updating data with PUT requests.
- **delete-request.js**: Deleting data with DELETE requests.

### 4. Handling Responses

- **response-types.js**: Working with different response types like JSON, text, and blobs.
- **response-status.js**: Handling different HTTP status codes and responses.

### 5. Working with Async/Await

- **async-await.js**: Refactoring Fetch requests to use async/await for cleaner and more readable code.

### 6. Using Fetch with Local Storage

- **fetch-and-localstorage.js**: Storing and retrieving data from local storage after making Fetch requests.

### 7. Real-World Example: Weather App

- **weather-app.js**: A practical example of using the Fetch API in a weather application to fetch weather data from an external API.

## How to Use This Repository
